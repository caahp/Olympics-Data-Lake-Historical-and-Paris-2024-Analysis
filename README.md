# Olympics Data Lake: Historical and Paris 2024 Analysis

This project builds a local **Data Lake** to integrate and analyze data from two main sources:

1. **Historical Olympics data (1896–2022)** – provided by [Base dos Dados](https://basedosdados.org/dataset/62f8cb83-ac37-48be-874b-b94dd92d3e2b).
2. **Paris 2024 Summer Olympics data** – provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/paris-2024-olympic-summer-games).

The goal is to process, integrate, and analyze Olympic Games data, producing descriptive statistics and visualizations to answer key analytical questions.
