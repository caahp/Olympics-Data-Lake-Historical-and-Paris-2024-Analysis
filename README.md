# Olympics Data Lake: Historical and Paris 2024 Analysis

This project builds a local **Data Lake** to integrate and analyze data from two main sources:

1. **Historical Olympics data (1896‚Äì2022)** ‚Äì provided by [Base dos Dados](https://basedosdados.org/dataset/62f8cb83-ac37-48be-874b-b94dd92d3e2b).
2. **Paris 2024 Summer Olympics data** ‚Äì provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/paris-2024-olympic-summer-games).

The goal is to process, integrate, and analyze Olympic Games data, producing descriptive statistics and visualizations to answer key analytical questions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è ETL Process

1. **Raw Layer (`raw/`)**
   - Store original files as downloaded.
   - Generate metadata (`metadata.json`) with dataset description, source, and collection date.

2. **Bronze Layer (`bronze/`)**
   - Convert CSV/CSV.GZ files to **Parquet**.
   - Keep metadata aligned with processed files.
   - Integrate historical and Paris 2024 data into a unified dataset.

3. **Gold Layer (`gold/`)**
   - Generate summary tables, descriptive statistics, and visualizations.
   - Store Jupyter notebooks, charts, and reports.
